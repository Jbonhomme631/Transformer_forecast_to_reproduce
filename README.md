## üìú Overview

This project demonstrates the application of **Transformer neural networks** for **time series forecasting**. Originally designed for Natural Language Processing (NLP), Transformers are proving to be highly efficient in understanding the dependencies and patterns in sequential data such as time series. This repository contains the full implementation, training, and evaluation of a Transformer-based model designed to predict future values based on past sequences.

## üî• Key Features

- **Transformer Model**: Implements a custom Transformer architecture specifically designed for time series data.
- **Attention Mechanism**: Exploits the self-attention mechanism to capture both short-term and long-term dependencies.
- **Scalability**: Capable of handling large time series datasets.
- **Visualization**: Visualizes the actual vs predicted time series values.
- **Performance Metrics**: Provides detailed performance metrics, including MAE, MSE, and RMSE.
